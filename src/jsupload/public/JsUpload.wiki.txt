<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Goals =

Usage of the library without the need of knowing anything about gwt and java.
The generated javascript code is minimized, optimized and obfuscated and works fine in all Gwt supported browsers. 

= Setup instructions =

 # Download last version of the library: jsupload-x.x.x.jar and uncompress it in a folder.
 # In the server path you have to install one of the provided server programs to receive the files:
   Java: include the servlet provided with the gwtupload-x.x.x.jar in your application and configure your WEB-INF/web.xml file.
   {{{
    <servlet>
     <servlet-name>uploadServlet</servlet-name>
     <servlet-class>gwtupload.server.UploadServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
     <servlet-name>uploadServlet</servlet-name>
     <url-pattern>/upload-servlet</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
   }}} 
   CGI: put the provided jsupload.cgi script into a script folder in your web server, and set the action parameter in your javascript code.
   {{{
   uploader = new jsu.Upload({
      action: "/cgi-bin/jsupload.cgi" 
      [...]
   });
          
   }}}    
 # Include either the obfuscated or readable version of the javascript library in your html file.  You can use relative paths or full qualified ones because the library has been compiled using cross-site linker. The library takes care loading dynamically the needed images and css.
 {{{
     <script language="javascript" src="jsupload.JsUpload.nocache.js"></script>
 }}}
 # In your html code, define the jsuOnLoad() function wich will be called once the library is loaded.
 {{{
     <script language='javascript'>
      function jsuOnLoad() {
        [...]
      }
     </script>
 }}}
